11) Admissions by Day Type:
Weekdays have significantly higher admissions (3,269) than weekends (1,343), indicating uneven resource utilization.

12) Satisfaction by Admission Status:
Non-admitted patients have a slightly higher average satisfaction score (1.37) than admitted patients (1.36).

13) Non-Admitted Patients by Department:
The "None" category has the highest number of non-admitted patients (2,264), reflecting potential triage inefficiencies.

14) Satisfaction by Age and Gender:
Females aged 31-40 have the highest average satisfaction score (1.51), while those aged 71+ have the lowest (1.20). For Males, the 41-50 age group scores highest (1.50), and 31-40 scores lowest (1.30).

15) Wait Times by Department and Month:
Renal in June 2024 has the highest average wait time (52.00 minutes), with its lowest in February 2024 (27.50 minutes).
None in January 2024 peaks at 36.25 minutes, lowest in July 2023 (33.79 minutes).
General Practice peaks in April 2023 (36.25 minutes), lowest in July 2024 (32.86 minutes).
Orthopedics peaks in January 2024 (39.15 minutes), lowest in May 2023 (30.91 minutes).
Gastroenterology peaks in August 2023 (42.63 minutes), lowest in July 2023 (29.63 minutes).
Physiotherapy peaks in February 2024 (44.14 minutes), lowest in July 2024 (29.08 minutes).
Cardiology peaks in July 2023 (46.33 minutes), lowest in July 2024 (27.38 minutes).
Neurology peaks in September 2024 (44.90 minutes), lowest in September 2023 (23.86 minutes).


Recommendations
1) Enhance Triage for Non-Specialized Referrals:
Rationale: The "None" category’s high volume (5,400 patients) and non-admitted patient count (2,264) suggest inefficiencies in assigning patients to specialized departments.
Action: Improve triage training to ensure accurate department referrals, reducing the "None" category. Introduce decision-support tools to guide staff in directing patients to departments like General Practice or Orthopedics, especially for non-admitted patients.

2) Reduce Wait Times for Non-Admitted Patients and Key Age Groups:
Rationale: Non-admitted patients face longer wait times (35.55 minutes vs. 34.97 minutes), and the 31-40 age group experiences the highest wait times (35.61 minutes).
Action: Implement fast-track processing for non-admitted patients, such as dedicated check-out kiosks. Optimize scheduling for the 31-40 age group by increasing appointment availability or streamlining administrative tasks during peak hours.

3) Improve Satisfaction in Low-Performing Departments:
Rationale: Renal’s low satisfaction score (1.22) and high wait times (e.g., 52.00 minutes in June 2024) indicate operational challenges.
Action: Conduct patient feedback surveys in the Renal department to pinpoint issues (e.g., staff communication, facility quality). Increase staffing or equipment during high-wait months (e.g., June) and adopt best practices from Gastroenterology, which scores highest (1.76).

4) Balance Resource Utilization Across Time Periods:
Rationale: Admissions peak in August 2024 (530 patients) and are significantly higher on weekdays (3,269 vs. 1,343 on weekends), straining resources unevenly.
Action: Boost staffing and bed capacity in August and other high-admission months, using predictive analytics to anticipate demand. Expand weekend clinic hours or staffing to distribute admissions more evenly and improve patient access.

5) Tailor Services for Demographic-Specific Needs:
Rationale: Pacific Islanders report the highest satisfaction, while Females aged 71+ (1.20) and Males aged 31-40 (1.30) score lowest. Gender disparities exist in departments like "None" and Renal.
Action: Investigate factors driving Pacific Islander satisfaction (e.g., cultural sensitivity) and apply them to other groups. Develop targeted interventions for low-scoring groups, such as improved communication for Females aged 71+ and Males aged 31-40. Address low Renal referral counts (44 Males, 42 Females) with outreach to ensure equitable access.

6) Minimize Wait Times to Boost Satisfaction:
Rationale: Satisfaction drops significantly with wait times beyond 10 minutes (1.58 for 0-10 minutes vs. 1.34 for 21+ minutes).
Action: Implement real-time wait time tracking and patient notifications to manage expectations. Prioritize process improvements in departments with high wait times, such as Cardiology (46.33 minutes in July 2023) and Neurology (44.90 minutes in September 2024), by optimizing scheduling or adding resources during peak months.

Implementation Considerations

1) Real-Time Monitoring: Use dashboards to track wait times, satisfaction scores, and admission volumes, enabling timely interventions.
2) Department Collaboration: Engage Renal and other low-performing department leaders to prioritize improvements based on patient feedback.
3) Cost-Effective Changes: Start with low-cost solutions like triage training and scheduling adjustments before investing in major staffing or equipment upgrades.
4) Continuous Feedback: Establish regular patient surveys to monitor the impact of changes and identify new opportunities.
